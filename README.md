# Homebridge Arduino ENC28J60 Light
Added HomeKit support to my selfmade LED roomlamp using Raspberry, Arduino and ENC28J60 Module.
The lamp is dimmable, sends its status, can be turned on and off with a physical switch and can be controlled via a webbrowser.

## Homebridge
Soon the configurationfile of homebridge will appear.

## Arduino
I just uploaded my latest Arduino project. It has some bugs though. :(

## Hardware
Don't be afraid, it isn't that much hardware. More precisely, just one electronic component is needed to make it work... for testing purpose.
